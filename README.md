T2Z
========

"T2Z" means "convert Time to the Z axis." This Processing program helps you create and control 2D animations. It then can turn those animations into 3D printable models by stacking the frames one atop the other and generating the surface between the objects and the background.

T2Z is one key program in a larger effort called "323," which explores converting from various dimensional representations to others.
