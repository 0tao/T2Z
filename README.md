T2Z
========

"T2Z" means "convert Time to the Z axis." This Processing program helps you create and control 2D animations. It then can turn those animations into 3D printable models by stacking the frames one atop the other and generating the surface between the objects and the background.

T2Z is one key program in a larger effort called "323," which explores converting from various dimensional representations to others.

*Note: We'll be running a computer workshop for 65-70 people at SIGGRAPH 2015 on Sunday, August 9th from 12:15 to 1:45 PM. Called "Freezing Time," we'll explain how to make these animations and sculptures; computers are provided for participants. See the [Advanced Program](http://s2015.siggraph.org/sites/default/files/s15_Final%20Advance%20Program.pdf), page 25, for a few more details, along with other Maker activities at SIGGRAPH 2015. Hope to see you there!*
