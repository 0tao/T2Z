<h1>What's This Thing?</h1>
<p>
<b>Freezing Time</b> is a project to help you create cool
animation loops,
and then turn them into cool 3D objects that you can print
and hold in your hand.
</p>
<p>
We create the 3D sculptures by imagining the frames of
your animation in one big stack.
We carve away all the pixels that have the color
of the background,
and what's left becomes your model.
</p>
<p>
When you're ready,
you can open up the code and write your own animations.
Our examples are just a start!
</p>
<p>
We call our process <em>Freezing Time</em>.
The code we wrote to carry it out is called
<b>Project T2Z</b>, because
it places time on the Z axis.

<h3>What's This Doc?</h3>
<p>
A bare-bones, get-started-quick overview.
</p>
<p>
When you're ready to write your own
animations, the comments in the code
will be your guides.
</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>
To get started, download and install these two
free, open-source programs.
Both have versions for Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux.
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.processing.org" target="_new">Processing version 2.2.1</a>: 
This is a graphics programming language based on Java. 
There's an IDE (Integrated Programming Environment - basically
an editor along with buttons to let you run your program).
You'll be running the system from within Processing.
<b>Be sure to get version 2.2.1!</b>. 
Because version 3 makes big changes to the Processing internals,
the libraries we rely on are not
compatible with Processing version 3, or any of the beta
releases of that version.
You may have to scroll down to the <em>Stable Releases</em>
section to find version 2.2.1.
</p>
<p>
If you want to use Processing to develop your own programs,
you'll probably want to use Processing 3.
See the section below on how to install both versions successfully.
</p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/ target="_new">MeshLab</a>:
This is a great program for interactively viewing your 3D models.
</ul>
<h4>Running both Processing 2 and Processing 3</h4>
<p>
If you just want to run T2Z, then you're set:
you have Processing 2.2.1, and you can skip this section and
jump down to <em>Installing Libraries</em>.
If, however, you want to also run Processing 3,
then here's how you can have both.
</p>
<p>Happily, you can have both version 2 (which I'll call P2) 
and version 3 (which I'll call P3) installed side by side,
though you should only be running one at a time.
To enable this, you need to do a few things.
First, install both programs:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install Processing 2.2.1. </li>
<li> When the
installation is finished, find the installed program
and rename it <em>ProcessingV2</em>.
If you're on a Mac, you'll find your installed program
inside <em>/Applications</em>. 
On a PC, it's typically at C:\processing-2.2.1.
</li>
<li>Start your new ProcessingV2, and once it's up 
and running, exit (that is, choose <em>Processing/Quit Processing</em>
from the menu).</li>
<li>Download and install Processing 3 (whatever version is on the front page)</li>
<li>Start your new version 3 Processing. 
If it asks you if you want to make a Sketchbook, say no.
Once it's open,
choose <em>Processing/Preferences...</em>.
At the bottom of the pop-up window it will tell you the location
of your preferences file.
Copy that into some other window or write it down;
we'll need it later.
Now quit Processing.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Now that you have both programs installed, you need to tell them
how to stay out of each other's way. Processing keeps all your
libraries and other files in a folder it calls your <em>Sketchbook</em>.
By default both P2 and P3 refer to the same folder, which isn't good.
So let's point them to different places.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the default location for your Sketchbook.
On the Mac, it's at 
<pre>/Users/YourNameHere/Documents</pre>
and on a PC, it's at
<pre>C:/Users/YourNameHere/Documents</pre>
In this folder, make a new folder called
<pre>ProcessingV2</pre>.</li>
<li>Open the preferences file that you copied or wrote
down from the Preferences window above.
This is a plain-text file, so you can use any text editor.
Around line 105, 
you'll find two entries starting
with the word <em>sketchbook</em>.
These entries may change as Processing 3 goes through
its beta phase, so use the settings below
as a guide, and adapt them to what you actually see in the
file when you open it up.
</p>
<p>
If you're on a Mac, set them as follows,
replacing <em>YourNameHere</em> with your user name:
<pre>
sketchbook.path=/Users/YourNameHere/Documents/ProcessingV2 
sketchbook.path.three=/Users/YourNameHere/Documents/Processing
</pre>
If you're on a PC, set them this way:
<pre>
sketchbook.path=C:\Users\YourNameHere\Documents\ProcessingV2 
sketchbook.path.three=C:\Users\YourNameHere\Documents\Processing
</pre>
</li>
<li>Again run, and then quit, version 2.</li>
<li>Again run, and then quit, version 3.</li>
</ol>
<p>
That's it, now both versions of Processing will have their
own sketchbooks, and they should co-exist happily.
Remember to only run one at a time.
</p>
<p>
Note that when you're running Processing 2.2.1 it may occasionally
prompt you to upgrade to the newer version.
Say no! 
You already have version 3 installed,
and you don't want to replace your version 2 copy as long
as you're planning to run T2Z.
</p>
<p>
That's it. In time, all of this version 2/version 3 stuff will probably
get smoothed out and things will get much simpler.
</p>
<h3>Installing Libraries</h3>
<p>
You'll also need to install three Processing libraries.
The easiest way to do this is using Processing's built-in
tools, and indeed that's how we recommend adding libraries
when you're running Version 3.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, if you use the automatic installer for
Version 2 it seems to be sometimes incorrectly
retreive libraries for Version 3, which creates all kinds
of mess.
So we'll next get working copies of the libraries for Version 2,
and then manually install them.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to our
<a href="http://erich.realtimerendering.com/t2z/downloads/" target="_blank">downloads page</a>,
right-click on each of the three zip files,
and save them somewhere where you can find them again
(e.g., your Downloads folder, or your desktop).</li>
<li>Double-click on each zip file to expand it. It should produce
a folder of the same name as the zip file.</li>
<li>Now copy those folders (which contain the libraries) into
your Processing Version 2 libraries folder.
If you didn't install Version 3 using the directions above,
then copy your three library folders into
<pre>
/Users/YourNameHere/Documents/Processing/libraries
</pre>
on a Mac, or
<pre>
C:\Users\YourNameHere\Documents\Processing\libraries
</pre>
on a PC.
</p>
<p>
If you did install Version 3 as above, then
replace <em>Processing</em> in these paths with <em>ProcessingV2</em>.
<b>Make sure you're copying your folders into the Processing 2 libraries folder!</b>.
If you accidentally put them into the Processing 3 folder,
they won't show up in Processing 2, and they
won't work in Processing 3, either.
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Installing T2Z</h3>
<p>
Finally, download and install our code itself.
</p>
<ul><li> Get the source in a zip
file from the 
<a href="http://bit.ly/t2zspot" target="_blank">T2Z spot</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Unzip it and place the resulting <em>ProjectT2Z</em> 
folder somewhere convenient.
It's important that you don't rename the folder!
You can put it anywhere you like, but Processing has
some requirements about matching the name of the folder
to the files it contains,
so don't change the name.
</p>

<h1>Running the Program</h1>

<p>
If you didn't install Processing version 3,
then simply
open the <em>T2Z</em> folder and double-click on 
the file <em>ProjectT2Z.pde</em>.
That should open up Processing, and you'll see something
like the figure below.
</p>
<p>
If you have both version 2 and version 3 installed,
you'll need to manually start version 2 and then
open the program,
since double-clicking on the pde file will open
version 3, which is incompatible with T2Z.
So start Processing version 2 manually,
then choose <em>File/Open...</em> from the menu bar,
and open the file <em>ProjectT2Z.pde</em> in the <em>ProjectT2Z</em>
folder you unzipped during installation.
(note: some of the figures show some variations
on the name <em>Project323</em> rather than <em>ProjectT2Z</em>.
Don't worry, that was just an earlier name).
</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/ProcessingIDE.png" alt="Screenshot" width="100%">
<figcaption>
Left: The Processing environment that opens up when you
double-click on <em>ProjectT2Z.pde</em>.
Right: The "start" and "stop" buttons.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
This is the Processing IDE.
You can select any of the tabs along the top to 
see the file it contains.
And, of course, you can edit the code,
when you're ready to do that.
</p>
<p>
For now, <b>start</b> the program by pressing
the big right-pointing arrow in the upper-left of the IDE.
When you want to quit, you can do that in four ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the <em>Exit</em> button in the <em>Sculpture Controls</em> window 
(the one with the red background), and confirm you want to quit.</li>
<li>Move the mouse into the <em>Sketch Window</em> 
and press the escape key on your keyboard.</li>
<li>Click the close box on the <em>Sketch Window</em>.</li>
<li>Click the square <em>Stop</em> button in the Processing IDE.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Overview of the UI</h1>
<p>
Let's jump right into things. I strongly suggest
that you open the project and run it,
trying things out as we discuss them.
</p>
<p>
There are four windows: three with user interface
controls and one where you preview your animation.
</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/UIComp.png" alt="User Interface Windows" width="50%">
<figcaption>
The four windows of the UI.
</figcaption>
</figure>


<h1>Quick Start</h1>

<p>
Let's make some stuff happen.
</p>
<p>
In the <em>Animation Controls</em> window (the one with 
a light-green background),
choose an animation from the drop-down list at the top.
Click on the dark blue bar at the far right to choose an animation.
The sliders will change to display the controls for that animation.
</p>
<p>
Click the <em>Run Animation</em> button in the <em>Camera Controls</em>
window (the one with a yellow background).
Your animation should run in the <em>Sketch Window</em>.
While it's running, feel free to move the sliders around until
you get an animation loop you like.
</p>
<p>
If one of the sliders is red,
and you move it,
the animation will stop. 
Making a slider red is a hint from the animation author that this
slider controls some computation that can take a little while
(usually a second or two). So if you move one of these sliders,
the animation stops. You can continue to move the rest of the sliders
if you want. To get the animation running, 
push the <em>Run Animation</em> button again.
</p>
<p>
When you have the animation the way you want,
press the red <em>Stop Animation</em> button (that's what the
<em>Run Animation</em> button turns into when you press it).
</p>
<p>
To save your animation as an animated gif, check the box 
labeled <em>Build GIF Animation</em> in the
bottom-right of the <em>Camera Controls</em> window,
and then press <em>Record Animation</em>.
You'll see a single cycle of your animation play and
then automatically stop.
If you look in your T2Z directory, you'll see a gif file
with the name of your chosen animation, followed by the time
of creation. This is ready for sharing and posting to
social media. (Well, to be honest, the GIF animation component
sometimes has problems with choosing colors. If you get flickering
colors in your GIF, save as PNG instead and make a GIF from them.)
</p>
<p>
If you'd like to save the individual frames, check the
<em>Save PNG Frames</em> button, and then press
<em>Record Animation</em>. The frames will show up in the T2Z
folder, in a folder given by the name in the 
text box labeled <em>PNG File Directory</em> at the top of the 
window. One way to turn a set of PNGs into a GIF is to use the
free, online <a href="http://ezgif.com/maker">EZGIF maker</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you want, you can save both an animated GIF and the PNG 
files at the same time.
Keep in mind that you must press <em>Record Animation</em>
to save your results;
pressing <em>Run Animation</em> will simply play it
without saving anything.
</p>
<p>
When you're ready to save your animation for 3D printing,
press the big <em>Build Sculpture</em> button in the
<em>Sculpture Controls</em> window (the one with the red background).
In your T2Z folder you'll see an STL file that uses the name
that's in the upper-left of this panel
(because we're sure your creations will be amazing,
we've given that file the default name Amazohedron.stl,
but you can change it to anything you like).
You can then send your STL file to your 3D printer,
if you have one,
or to one of the 3D printing services to print for you
(a few are named in the FAQ seciton).
</p>


<h1>Animation Controls</h1>

<figure>
<img src="images/AnimationControls.png" alt="Animation Controls" height="500">
<figcaption>
The <em>Animation Controls</em> window.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
This window lets you pick which animation you
want to work on, and
then tune its parameters to your liking.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Animation Choice</b>:
A drop-down list where you choose which animation you
want to work with. 
Click on the dark blue bar at the right side
of the box to open the drop-down.
</li>
<li><b>Animation Parameters</b>:
Each animation will give you its own custom set of sliders
to control what gets drawn.
If the slider is blue, then you can move it around in 
real time as the animation runs.
If the slider is red, that means changing it requires the
animation to do some computation. 
Moving a red slider will stop the animation.
You can then move all the sliders around all you like.
When you're ready to see the result,
press the <em>Run Animation</em> button (discussed
below in the <em>Camera Controls</em> window).
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Camera Controls</h1>

<figure>
<img src="images/CameraControls.png" alt="Camera Controls" height="500">
<figcaption>
The <em>Camera Controls</em> window.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
This window lets you control the size and length
of your animation, and include motion blur if you like.
You can preview the animation, or save it as an
animated GIF or a folder full of individual PNG files,
one per frame.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>PNG File Directory</b>:
If you choose to save your frames one by as in PNG format,
this is the directory name that will be used to save them.
This is located inside the <em>ProjectT2Z</em> folder.
</li>
<li><b>Image Controls</b>:
<ul>
<li><b>Number of Frames</b>: Length of your animation loop in frames.</li>
<li><b>Frame Size</b>: Size of the square holding your animation, in pixels.
The preview window is 500 by 500. If you choose a smaller size, your graphics
will appear in the upper-left of that window. They will always be saved at
the size you specify here.</li>
<li><b>Snapshots per frame</b>: 
If your animation moves fast and things are jumping around quickly,
you can build your frames with motion blur. This will take longer,
but the animation will look better, and your 3D model will usually
look a bit better, too.
Moving this slider to the right tells the system how many subframes
to generate and average together to simulate motion blur. Try using
a small value at first, and increase it as needed until things look good.
The default value is 1, which means no motion blur.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Run Animation</b> Button: Start the animation in the 
<em>Sketch Window</em>. If you have any blue sliders in the 
<em>Animation Controls</em> window, you can move them around
as the animation runs. 
Red sliders will stop the animation.
Press the <b>Run Animation</b> button to restart the animation
using the current values of the sliders.
When the animation is running, this button will change name
to <b>Stop Animation</b>. Press that to stop the animation.
</li>
<li><b>Saving box</b>:
<ul>
<li><b>Build GIF Animation</b>:
Check this box to save your animation as an animated GIF file.
The file will show up in the <em>ProjectT2Z</em> folder.
You need to press the <b>Record Animation</b> button to 
save the animated GIF file.
</li>
<li><b>Save PNG Frames</b>:
Like the checkbox above, but the system will save each 
frame of your animation as its own .png file when you 
press the <b>Record Animation</b> button. The frames are
automatically numbered. They are placed in a folder
in the <em>ProjectT2Z</em> folder. The name of this new
folder is given in the text box in the <em>PNG File Directory</em>
region at the top of this window.
</li>
<li><b>Record Animation</b>: 
If either of the above checkboxes is turned on,
the system will run through your animation loop once,
creating the file (or files) you've asked for.
It will automatically stop after running through
one cycle of the animation.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Sculpture Controls</h1>

<figure>
<img src="images/SculptureControls.png" alt="Sculpture Controls" height="500">
<figcaption>
The <em>Sculpture Controls</em> window.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
This window is all about how you make your 3D model
from the 2D animation.
The basic idea is that we stack up your frames one on top of the other.
We then remove all pixels that have the background color,
and they turn into empty air.
Every pixel that's not the background will turn into real
physical stuff by the 3D printer.
</p>


<li><b>STL File name</b>:
The standard file format for 3D printers is .stl.
Here you can give the file name that we save for
your 3D model, if you don't like the awesome default.
</li>
<li><b>Structure</b>:
These two sliders let you specify how your frames
get stacked up to make the sculpture.
<ul>
<li><b>Offset</b>:
Your animation is a loop. The model defaults to starting
with frame 0 at the bottom, and following frames are stacked
on top of it.
But you can start anywhere in the loop by moving this
slider to a percentage between 0 and 1.
</li>
<li><b>Number of Cycles</b>:
You can repeat the animation more than once if you want.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li><b>The Block</b>:
A lot of animations turn into models with pieces that aren't
all connected to one another. If that model was printed,
the individual pieces would just fall apart (picture a bunch
of parallel tubes).
To fix this problem, you can create a <em>block</em> that
runs the full size of the printing area. You can control
the thickness of the block and where it appears.
Place it at the bottom of your model, and it's a base.
Put it at the top, and it's a table top.
Put it in the middle, and it just looks cool.
<ul>
<li><b>Include the Block</b>:
Check this box to include the block in your file.
It enables the two controls below.
</li>
<li><b>Block Start</b>:
Where the block should appear.
Think of your animation stack running from 0 at the
bottom to 1 at the top.
Move the slider to where you want the block to appear.
</li>
<li><b>Block Height (cm)</b>:
The height of the block in centimeters.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Cost Estimate</b>:
This is a <em>rough estimate</em> of how much it'll cost
to print this at <a href="http://www.shapeways.com" target="_blank">Shapeways</a>
out of their &quot;white strong &amp; flexible&quot; material
(of course, you can choose a different material when
you build it, or you can choose a completely
different 3D printing service).
You have to build the sculpture using the
<em>Build Sculpture</em> button to get this estimate.
Making changes to your animation or sculpture will
clear the estimate;
build the sculpture again to get a new estimate.
</li>
<li><b>Triangle Count</b>:
How many triangles are in your model.
Like the cost estimate above,
you have to build the sculpture first to
get this count,
and when you move sliders,
the count will go away.
Note that you can alter the model (including
removing triangles) in many 3D modeling programs,
including MeshLab,
which you installed above. More on this later.
</li>
<li><b>Build Speedup</b>:
Very big, complicated models can take a while to 
build. If you only want a quick, rough preview,
you can crank up the <b>Speedup</b> slider.
Things will go faster, but your model will be rougher.
Be sure to send this back down to 1 before saving
your final model.
</li>
<li><b>Size</b>:
Big models look great, but they cost more than
smaller models. Sometimes it's worth printing a
model out at small size so you can look it over
before spending the money for a big model.
<ul>
<li><b>Height (cm)</b>:
How tall the model should be, in centimeters.
</li>
<li><b>Cross Section Scale</b>:
Set the size of the 
model's width and depth relative to the height.
Lower means a skinnier model, higher means squatter.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Build Sculpture</b> button:
This will run through your animation and produce
a file in .stl format for 3D printing. It will
automatically stop after one cycle.
When the model is built, the cost estimate
and triangle counts above will be filled in.
You can also open the model in 
<a href="http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/">MeshLab</a>
and check it out!
Hint: if you use the same name every time,
you can just hit the refresh button in MeshLab
to re-load your model. 
On some platforms (like Windows)
MeshLab has a bug, 
requiring you to jiggle the view a bit with the
mouse to get it to refresh.
</li>
<li><b>Exit</b> button:
Press this to bring up a dialog box 
confirming that you want to exit.
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Sketch Window</h1>

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h3>Why isn't this browser-based?</h3>
<p>
In a word, <em>files</em>. 
We save a lot of files (your GIF animation,
the PNG frames, and the stl sculpture file).
For very good security reasons, code running in your browser
cannot easily save files onto your computer's hard drive.
We'd love to run this in a browser,
but saving the output files is more important.
</p>
<h3>My GIF files don't look right. What can I do?</h3>
<p>
Making animated GIF files is surprisingly hard, because
the GIF format only allows 256 colors per image.
Each program that turns frames into an animated GIF
(called an encoder),
somehow has to choose those colors, and decide if it
wants to save space by 
sometimes re-using the same colors 
for multiple frames.
Each encoder seems to do things its own way,
and they all have some conditions under which the
results come out lousy.
</p>
<p>
We're using a good encoder, 
but if your animation is in its weak zone,
you can try another encoder.
Just save your frames in PNG format,
and use another GIF encoder to mash them together
(<a href="http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/" target="_blank">gifsicle</a>
is a popular choice that runs on most operating systems).
Note that for some encoders,
you might have to turn your PNG files into
GIF files first.
</p>
<h3>So why not save these as GIF rather than PNG?</h3>
<p>
Each individual GIF image is limited to 256 colors,
whether it's in an animation or not.
So if we saved the frames in GIF format,
we'd have to throw away all but 256 colors.
For complex pictures that can look pretty bad.
</p>
<p>
So we save your images in the lossless PNG format,
so they're perfect and uncompromised.
If you later want to turn them into something
like GIF or JPG, there are tons of free
programs all over the web that can 
do that for you (just search for
<em>file format converter</em> and pick
one that looks good to you).
</p>
<h3>How do I make my own animations?</h3>
<p>
Open the <em>Animations.pde</em> tab and read the
comments at the top.
Then write your new animation and add it to the
drop-down list. That's it!
You'll need to know some Processing.
</p>
<h3>How can I learn Processing?</h3>
<p>
There are lots of ways to learn Processing.
There are some tutorials on
Processing's own <a href="https://processing.org/tutorials/" target="_blank">tutorials page</a>,
and there are tons of videos and web pages
all over the web.
In particular,
we like the videos from 
<a href="http://icm.shiffman.net/" target="_blank">Daniel Shiffman</a>,
and of course we recommend Andrew's 
<a href="http://www.imaginary-institute.com" target="_blank">online
Processing course</a>.

<h3>Any tips about making sculptures?</h3>

Normally you want to avoid rapidly moving small objects in your animation, as these will create very thin objects that are difficult to 3D print. You don't need a 3D printer to get models printed. There are a fair number of consumer-friendly service firms that will do so for you, such as <a href="http://shapeways.com">Shapeways</a>, <a href="http://sculpteo.com">Sculpteo</a>, <a href="https://www.3dhubs.com/">3D Hubs</a>, <a href="http://i.materialise.com/">i.materialise</a>, and <a href="https://www.ponoko.com/">Ponoko</a>. Shapeways has some <a href="https://www.shapeways.com/materials/strong-and-flexible-plastic?li=nav">good information</a> on design constraints for 3D printing.

When you make a final export, crank up the number of frames, frame size, and snapshots per frame to their maximums. The build will go much slower, but the resulting mesh will be more detailed and smoother.

At this high quality the STL model file produced is huge. To make your mesh small enough to upload successfully, we recommend <a href="http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/">MeshLab</a> for quick mesh simplification. See <a href="https://youtu.be/w_r-cT2jngk?t=99">this short bit of video</a> for how to use it. To sum up: use Filters | Remeshing | Quadric Edge Collapse Decimation. Check "Preserve Topology." Set target number of faces to 1300000 (1.3 million) for <a href="http://shapeways.com">Shapeways</a>, then Apply, then Close. File | Export Mesh As... and export the mesh as an STL.
